	<p>  Those artists featured most often in skate videos span a diverse array of genres. Surprisingly, the most popular artists come from Classic Rock, with The Beatles, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, CCR and The Rolling Stones all seeing high prominence. In fact, The Beatles and The Rolling Stones are the two most popular artists across all skate videos.
	On the one hand, this is surprising. Classic rock is about as 'mainstream' as music gets, yet skateboarding music is supposed to be this coveted playlist of the counterculture. That said, this wasn't always the case, 
	both started off as counterculture and became very mainstream (skateboarding is entering the 2020 Olympics).

	<h4> The dominance of Classic Rock</h4>
	<p> 
	Perhaps the most surprising result is the dominance of classic rock. While it's not the most popular genre overall (Indie and Hip Hop take that credit), it features the largest quantity of most-used artists.
	The results is surprising because those artists, including The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and Pink Floyd, are are fairly 'mainstream' - so, apart from making good music, how did they come to dominate the so-called soundtrack of the counterculture? 
	Aside from just 

	Despite their popularity, many classic rock songs still conjure up the counterculture spirit of skateboarding. Take a look at the most used songs in Classic Rock:

	These songs all __.
	Additionally, something can be said of the macro-similarities between classic rock and skateboarding. Both started off as symbols of the counter-culture, only to later gain mass appeal (skateboarding is heading to the 2020 Olympics), and have become influential pieces of contemporary culture.

	<h4> Hip Hop Favors the Veterans </h4>
	<p>
	As opposed to contemprary rappers (Kendrick Lamar, Drake, Kanye West, etc.). Hip Hop takes a favoring to older, more lyrical-based artists, like Gang Starr and Public Enemy. While this could be a result of time, consider the following time series of these artists, showing results independent of time.

	Indie and Punk 

	Jazz

	Electronic music is used sparsely in skate videos. Sol, the most popular artist, had the intro-theme for the monthly 411 Video Magazine. Odd Nosdam and Baron, the second and third most popular artists of the genre, respecitvely, each did the music for an entire skate video. Adeodat Warfield, with a respectable-for-the-genre 11 plays, is himself a popular skateboarder from Arizona.

	

	Those artists most-often associated with skateboarding belong to the punk and indie genres. Artists like Joy Division, Fugazi, Dinosaur Jr. and Modest Mouse are staples of skateboarding cultre, and appropriately see high-usage, consistently over time. The genres also have the largest number of unique artists


	Also among the most-featured artists are skateboarding staples Joy Division, Sonic Youth, Dinosaur Jr. and Modest Mouse. With the likes of Nas, Gang Starr, Biggie, and Public Enemy, hip hop is well represented as well.

	 In what is perhaps another surprise, punk music is less prevalent at the upper ends of popularity, That said, Fugazi is the third most-used artist across all videos, while Devo, GG Allin, and Black Flag

	 <p> It should be mentioned that genre classification is ambigous and subjective, and [even within a single genre](https://pudding.cool/2017/03/punk/), can be quite a dynamic process. I favored large, broad gender categories because more micro-level classifications were too small to track meaningful changes in genre.
