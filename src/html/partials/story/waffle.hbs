			Temporal shifts in genre parallel cultural shifts in skateboarding, at least at the macro level. This is especially true for skateboarding's earlier days, when the culture was smaller and, therefore, more homogenous. But how well do genres map to more micro level details of skate culture? 
			<br>
			<br>
			Particular companies often represent particular styles of skateboarding, so to investigate, I looked at the genre distributions for thirty-two of the most popular skateboarding-affiliated companies.

			Genre provides a representative encoding for the style and aesthetics of many skate companies. Some observations are immediately apparent:
			<br>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li> <p>The most dominant example of genre loyalty is DGK's whopping 92% use of Hip Hop. Other companies, namely SK8MAFIA and Zoo York, also employ Hip Hop as their majority choice of genre.
			Interestingly, these three companies are all generally known for technical street skating. Thus, the association between Hip Hop and technical street skating still exists to this day, far beyond their coupled rising in the 1990s.</p> 
			</li>

				<li> <p>Metal music is most often associated with transition skating. This association is clearly rooted in reality, as transition-focused companies, such as Blood Wizard, Bacon, and Creature, see the highest employment of the genre.</p> 
				</li>

				<li> <p>Indie music, which has already been established as something of the music-for-the-masses, proves true to its name, with almost every company featuring at least 10% of the genre. Not a whole lot to say there - it just pairs well with skateboarding.</p> 
				</li>
				<li> <p>All of the companies that use Jazz 20% or more of the time sponsor skaters that were featured in Spike Jonze's classic 1993 video "Video Days", one of the first videos to pair Jazz with skateboarding. Some influences can't be understated.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
