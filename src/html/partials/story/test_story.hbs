				<h4>Genre Evolution Over Time</h4>

				<h4> The Beginnings </h4>
				<p>Skate videos became an established feature of skateboarding culture in the later-half of the 1980s.
				For skateboarding, the 1980s were a pretty wild time; many DIY, skater-run companies were forming, vert skating, with its eclectic and show-man personalities, was in full popularity, and skateboarding was, for the first time, seeing commercial success.
				Early skate videos, borrowing from their counter-culture origins, were overwhelmingly dominated by punk rock music.
				<br><br>
				 Although many of the artists featured in the first videos were groups formed by the skaters themselves,  early punk icons, such as Black Flag, The Faction, and Descendents, saw prominent use.
				 <br><br>
				The iconic noise rock duo Sonic Youth, an artist heavily used throughout skateboarding, was first featured in a skate video in 1989, years before their mainstream success in the 1990s/2000s.

				<h4> The 90's </h4>
                <p> In the 90’s, the popularity of skateboarding ended - it was no longer 'cool', and many aspects of the culture changed. Vert skating died, technical street skating took over, and skateboarding entered the infamous era of ‘big pants, small wheels’[image link?]. 
                <br><br>
                While punk music saw a large decline in popularity, Hip Hop entered skating's discography for the first time,  and quickly took over as the decade's most popular genre. 
                In some manner, Hip Hop became something of the new counter-culture anthem. [ask matt for general sentence here].
                Artists such as Gang Starr, Mobb Deep, and A Tribe Called Quest, who would become staples in skateboarding, were used for the first time, and set the tone of future soundtracks for years to come.
                <br><br>
                This was also a popular decade for Jazz/Funk/Soul artists, likely thanks to Spike Jonze's highly influential Video Days, which released in 1991 and featued the likes of John Coltrane, War, and The Jackson 5.
                 </p>

				<h4> The early 2000's </h4>

				<p>The success of shows such as Jackass and Viva La Bam ushered skateboarding out from the dumps and into pop-culture.
				<br><br>

				Throughout the decade, te popularity of Hip Hop gradually decreases, and is eclipsed by Indie and Classic Rock (the former has come to dominate skateboarding ever since). 

				Popular skateboarding adopts a 'bigger-is'better' approach, and the dominant style of skateboarding shifts from technical street skating to 'gnarly' stairs and rails.

				These changes also reflected in the general aesthetics of skateboarders: pants became tighter, shoes gradually got less puffy, and hair became longer. 
				<br><br>
				

				The most popular Classic Rock artists during this time were The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, while for Indie it was MGMT  and Modest Mouse.

				<h4> The Contemporary</h4>
				<p>
				With skating becoming more and more popular, no unifying trend is eveident, and unlike decades past, the current era of skateboarding sees no *single* defining aesthetic. In fact, almost all styles/approaches have an audience, and trends are even [coming back].</p>
				<p>Appropriately Indie music, which itself is a broad categorization of music, is the most popular genre. That said, all genres see non-trivial employment in skate videos.</p>
				<p>In some twist of fate, the inspiration for this plot, Joy Division, is the most popular artist of the current decade. (I modeled it after their Unkwnown Pleasure's album cover).  

				In another twist of fate, Sonic Youth, which (as mentioned) was used in some of skateboarding's first videos, breaks the top-five most used artists. Some things just fit well [there's probably a better phrase here]
