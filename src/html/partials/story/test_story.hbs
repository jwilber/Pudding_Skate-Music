				<h4>Genre Evolution Over Time</h4>
				  <p>As with any sufficiently developed culture, skateboarding has gone through, and continues to go through, temporal shifts in styles and trends.</p>
				  <p>Particular music genres are often associated with particular styles in skateboarding. For example, hip hop is often used with technical street skating, while heavier, faster music (e.g. Punk or Metal) is generally used with transition skating.</p>
				  <p>It's not surprising, then, that the year-to-year changes in the genre of skate videos reflects the year-to-year changes in the styles of skateboarding. That is, we can use the popularity of music for a given time-frame to understand which types of skateboarding were popular in that period.</p>

				<h4> The Beginnings </h4>
				<p>Skate videos became an established feature of skateboarding culture in the later-half of the 1980s.
				<br><br>
				For skateboarding, the 1980s were a pretty wild time. Many DIY, skater-run companies were forming. Vert skating, with its eclectic and show-man personalities, was in full popularity. And skateboarding was, for the first time, seeing commercial success.
				Early skate videos, borrowing from skateboarding's counter-culture origins, were overwhelmingly dominated by punk rock music.
				<br><br>
				 Although many of the artists featured in the first videos were temporary groups formed by the skaters themselves,  early punk icons, such as Black Flag, The Faction, and Descendents, saw prominent use.
				 <br><br>
				In fact, many artists were featured in skate videos before their eventual rise to popularity. For example, the iconic noise rock duo Sonic Youth, an artist heavily used throughout skateboarding, was first featured in a skate video in 1989, years before their mainstream success in the 1990s/2000s.

				<h4> The 90's </h4>
                <p> In the 1990’s, the mainstream popularity of skateboarding died. It was no longer considered cool, and many aspects of the culture changed. Vert skating died, technical street skating took over, and skateboarding entered the infamous era of ‘big pants, small wheels’[image link?]. 
                <br><br>
                While punk music saw a large decline in popularity, Hip Hop entered skateboarding's discography for the first time, quickly taking over as the decade's most popular genre. 
                In some manner, Hip Hop became something of the new counter-culture anthem. [ask matt for general sentence here]. [unpopularity of skatirng, but strong association with hip hop. also discuss association with technical street skating.]
                The strong association between Hip Hop and technical street skating was cemented during this decade.
                Artists such as Gang Starr, Mobb Deep, and A Tribe Called Quest were used for the first time, and set the tone of future soundtracks for years to come. 
                <br><br>
                This was also a popular decade for Jazz/Funk/Soul artists, likely thanks to Spike Jonze's highly influential Video Days, which released in 1991 and featued the likes of John Coltrane, War, and The Jackson 5.

				<h4> The early 2000's </h4>

				<p>The success of shows such as Jackass and Viva La Bam ushered skateboarding back into mainstream popularity, and popular skateboarding changed. The low-impact technical street skating of the 90s gave way to a 'bigger-is-better' approach, as skaters began to jump down larger rails and stairs. Fashion trends evolved as well: pants became tighter, shoes less puffy, and hair longer.
				<br><br>

				The music of skate videos evolved in tandem. Over the decade, the popularity of Hip Hop gradually decreased, with Indie and Classic Rock quickly rising to prominence.

				<br><br>
				

				The most popular Classic Rock artists during this time were The Beatles and The Rolling Stones. For Indie music, MGMT  and Modest Mouse held the throne.
				<br><br>

				Punk music, which saw a large decline in the 1990s, continued to drop in popularity.
				<br><br>
				Metal, Rock, and Electronic music, by all metrics the most unpopular genres in skateboarding, continued along the bottom, though [insert metal band] saw decent popular with [instert] uses across the decade.

				<h4> The Contemporary</h4>
				<p>
				The modern era sees skateboarding in peak popularity, with millions of skaters worldwide.
				As a result of the widespread popularity, the current era of skateboarding sees no *single* defining aesthetic, and almost all styles/approaches have an audience.  
				<p>Appropriately Indie music, which itself is a broad categorization of music, is the most popular genre.
				Hip Hop has gained a healthy resurgence.
				All genres see non-trivial employment in skate videos.</p>
				<p>In some twist of fate, Joy Division,the inspiration for this plot, is the most popular artist of the current decade. 

				Additionally Sonic Youth, which (as mentioned) was used in some of skateboarding's first videos, is among the top-five most used artists. I guess some music just pairs well with skateboarding.
